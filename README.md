# My First Website

## Overview  
This is my first website project! It's a dashboard-style application that displays information using interactive maps and charts. The project is currently a work in progress, built with HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and libraries like Leaflet, Tailwind CSS, and Chart.js to visualize data.  

## Features  
- **Interactive Map**: Using Leaflet, the website displays maps with multiple layers and markers to provide geographical data visualization.  
- **Dynamic Charts**: Chart.js is used to create various charts that track important statistics related to the data on the map.  
- **Responsive Layout**: The website is designed to be responsive with a sidebar that toggles between open and closed states.  

## Technologies  
- **HTML**: Provides the structure of the website.  
- **CSS**: Used for layout, styling, and responsive design, including flexbox and media queries.  
- **JavaScript**: Implements dynamic functionality, such as interactive elements, map controls, and chart updates.  
- **Leaflet**: A JavaScript library for interactive maps, enabling layering and map-based data visualization.  
- **Chart.js**: A charting library used to display dynamic charts representing various statistics.  

## Content  
The website consists of two pages. One provides the most up-to-date information about wildfires in the United States, ensuring that data is as current as possible. The second page focuses on the Camp Fire (2018), which was the most financially destructive wildfire.
